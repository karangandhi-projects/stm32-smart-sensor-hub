# 📘 STM32 Smart Sensor Hub  
### A Modular, Power-Aware Firmware System with CLI Dashboard, Logging Framework, and Sensor Abstraction  

**Target MCU:** STM32 Nucleo-F446RE  
**Toolchain:** STM32CubeIDE / arm-none-eabi-gcc  
**UART Interface:** ST-LINK VCP (typically USART2 @ 115200)

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **STM32 Smart Sensor Hub** is a professionally structured embedded firmware project built to demonstrate modern firmware engineering practices:

- Modular layered architecture  
- Cooperative task scheduler  
- Runtime-configurable structured logging framework  
- Interactive UART CLI (dashboard-style)  
- Power management system  
- Sensor abstraction (simulated sensor now, real sensors later)  
- **Dynamic sensor sampling period that adapts to the current power mode**  
- GitHub Actions CI (compile-only)  
- Full documentation  
- Clean, maintainable C code with Doxygen-ready comments  

This repository is structured like a real production firmware codebase.

## 🧩 Key Features

### ✔️ Cooperative Task Scheduler  

Tasks include:

- `Heartbeat`  
- `SensorSample`  
- `PowerManager`  
- `CLI`  

Each task has its own period and logs its execution timing.

---

### ✔️ Structured Logging Framework  

Log format:

```text
[00123456 ms][INF][../app/app_main.c:152][App_TaskSensorSample] Value=23.1 C
```

Supports:

- DEBUG / INFO / WARN / ERROR  
- Runtime filter control  
- CLI-controlled pause/resume  
- Automatic CLI prompt redraw after each log line  

---

### ✔️ UART CLI Dashboard  

Example commands:

```text
help
log pause
log resume
log info
log debug
pmode idle
status
```

Features:

- Non-blocking input  
- Backspace support  
- Dashboard-style, always-visible prompt  
- Logs never overwrite the CLI command entry line  

---

### ✔️ Sensor Abstraction Layer  

```c
typedef struct {
    bool (*init)(void);
    bool (*read)(SensorData_t *out);
} SensorIF_t;
```

Currently uses a simulated temperature sensor (`sensor_sim_temp.c/.h`)  
plugged into this interface.

Later you can plug in:

- I²C sensor  
- SPI sensor  
- ADC sensor  
- Additional simulated/virtual sensors for testing  

---

### ✔️ Power Management Framework + Dynamic Sampling

Power modes:

- `POWER_MODE_ACTIVE`
- `POWER_MODE_IDLE`
- `POWER_MODE_SLEEP`
- `POWER_MODE_STOP`

The **SensorSample** task period automatically adapts to the current power mode:

```c
#define SENSOR_PERIOD_ACTIVE_MS   (1000U)   // 1 second in ACTIVE mode
#define SENSOR_PERIOD_IDLE_MS     (5000U)   // 5 seconds in IDLE mode
#define SENSOR_PERIOD_SLEEP_MS    (30000U)  // 30 seconds in SLEEP mode
#define SENSOR_PERIOD_STOP_MS     (0U)      // 0 => no sampling in STOP
```

- In **STOP** mode, sensor sampling is completely disabled.  
- The CLI `status` command reports the **effective sensor sample period**.

This models how a real low-power system would adapt workload based on its power budget.

---

### ✔️ GitHub Actions CI

- Installs ARM GCC  
- Builds firmware on Ubuntu  
- Verifies compilation on every push & PR

## 🛠️ Build & Flash Instructions

1. Open the project in **STM32CubeIDE**.  
2. Build the project (Debug or Release).  
3. Flash the firmware to the **Nucleo-F446RE**.  
4. Open a serial monitor at **115200 baud**, 8N1.  
5. Reset the board and look for the CLI banner.  
6. Type `help` to see available commands.

## 💼 Resume Impact

This project demonstrates:

- Embedded architecture & modular design  
- Reusable driver and sensor abstraction  
- Task scheduling and power management  
- **Power-aware behavior (dynamic sensor sampling vs power mode)**  
- CLI protocol handling and UX considerations  
- Logging frameworks with runtime control  
- CI/CD discipline for embedded firmware  

Ideal to showcase for **Embedded/Firmware Engineer** roles.
